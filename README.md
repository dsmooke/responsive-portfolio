# Responsive Portfolio

## Description

This is the second assignment from the UConn Coding Bootcamp curriculum which combines ~our working knowledge of~ the first week's topics (Git, Terminal, HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, GitLab, and Web Accessibility) with the second week's topic: Bootstrap. 

 For this assignment we were to build a responsive portfolio from scratch. 


## Goals

1. A portfolio that is mobile responsive, or a website with webpages whose format and content respond to the visual constraints of a mobile phone and the latitude of a desktop. 

2. The code for the HTML must be accessible - the code must have semantic HTML. 

 ### Sub-goals
 
In order to be considered *Responsive* our site must have the following: 

- proper index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html files that adhere to accessibility standards (use semantic HTML)

- Proper use of Bootstrap components and grid system.

- A navbar that is consistent across each page

- On each page must contain (on navbar) links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages. (ex. *dsmooke.github.io/responsive-portfolio/home*)

- A responsive layout

- Responsive images that adjust with brower size

- A valid and correct HTML on each page (confirm via a validation service)

- Your personalized information (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

## Developer 

For my responsive portfolio I focued on properly using the Bootstrap Grid System.

While some developers would disagree with inserting comments that explain the function of each component of one's code, I, on the otherhand, believe that doing so makes my code more accessible, not only for the user, but also for anyone who wants to learn how to code. The detailed comments were not only for my own sanity, but for a future newbie who wants to make his/her/their own responsive portfolio.
